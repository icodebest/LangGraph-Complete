# LangChain

The LangGraph learning notebooks are in course-notebooks directory. We are using Google Models for learning langgraph.
## Introduction
This is a growing set of modules focused on foundational concepts within the LangChain ecosystem. Module 0 is basic setup and Modules 1 - 4 focus on LangGraph, progressively adding more advanced themes. In each module folder, you'll see a set of notebooks. A LangChain Academy accompanies each notebook to guide you through the topic. Each module also has a studio subdirectory, with a set of relevant graphs that we will explore using the LangGraph API and Studio.
