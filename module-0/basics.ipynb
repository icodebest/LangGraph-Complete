One type of LLM application you can build is an agent. There’s a lot of excitement around building agents because they can automate a wide range of tasks that were previously impossible.\n","\n","In practice though, it is incredibly difficult to build systems that reliably execute on these tasks. As we’ve worked with our users to put agents into production, we’ve learned that more control is often necessary. You might need an agent to always call a specific tool first or use different prompts based on its state.\n","\n","To tackle this problem, we’ve built [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — a framework for building agent and multi-agent applications. Separate from the LangChain package, LangGraph’s core design philosophy is to help developers add better precision and control into agent workflows, suitable for the complexity of real-world systems.\n","\n","## Course Structure\n","\n","The course is structured as a set of modules, with each module focused on a particular theme related to LangGraph. You will see a folder for each module, which contains a series of notebooks. A video will accompany each notebook to help walk through the concepts, but the notebooks are also stand-alone, meaning that they contain explanations and can be viewed independent of the videos. Each module folder also contains a `studio` folder, which contains a set of graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), our IDE for building LangGraph applications.\n","\n","## Setup\n","\n","Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the `README` to create an environment and install dependencies.\n","\n","## Chat models\n","\n","In this course, we'll be using [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which do a few things take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs. LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations. [Here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) is a list of 3rd party chat model integrations within LangChain! By default, the course with use [GEMINI_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key/) because it is both popular and performant. As noted, please ensure that you have an `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n","\n","Let's check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and, if not, you will be asked to enter it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0f9a52c8","metadata":{"id":"0f9a52c8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738868955970,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":6238,"user":{"displayName":"Waleed Usman","userId":"14222602887761143824"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture --no-stderr\n","!pip install -q langchain_google_genai langchain_core langchain_community tavily-python"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\n","\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","GEMINI_API_KEY = userdata.get('GEMINI_API_KEY')\n","llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(\n","    model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n","    api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY,\n","    temperature=0\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ch7HciDZXh3F","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738868966654,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":6072,"user":{"displayName":"Waleed Usman","userId":"14222602887761143824"}}},"id":"Ch7HciDZXh3F","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result  = llm.invoke(\"Tell me about Imran Khan\")\n","result"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KKnOnfj3YZYT","outputId":"23f15d04-9e18-43a9-dbb8-acfca795d65c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738869163023,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":4453,"user":{"displayName":"Waleed Usman","userId":"14222602887761143824"}}},"id":"KKnOnfj3YZYT","execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["AIMessage(content=\"Imran Khan is a Pakistani politician who served as the 22nd prime minister of Pakistan from 2018 to 2022.

These bricks include:\\n\\n* **Modules for interacting with LLMs:**  LangChain provides easy ways to connect to various LLMs, such as OpenAI\\'s GPT models, Hugging Face models, and others.  This abstracts away the complexities of API calls and authentication.\\n* **Memory:**  LLMs are stateless by nature. LangChain offers mechanisms to add memory to your applications, allowing the LLM to remember previous interactions within a conversation or task.  This is crucial for creating more context-aware and helpful applications.\\n* **Chains:**  These are sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities, allowing you to build complex workflows.  For example, you might chain together an LLM call to summarize text, followed by another call to translate the summary into a different language.\\n* **Indexes:**  LangChain helps you index and query your own data (documents, databases, etc.) so that the LLM can access and process information relevant to the user\\'s request.  This is essential for building applications that leverage your own private knowledge base.\\n* **Agents:**  These allow your application to decide which tools (LLMs, search engines, calculators, etc.) to use to answer a user\\'s question or complete a task.  This enables more sophisticated and adaptable applications.\\n\\n\\n**In short:** LangChain simplifies the process of building complex and powerful applications using LLMs by providing pre-built components and a structured approach.\\n\\n\\nLangGraph, on the other hand, is not a widely known or established framework like LangChain.

Official Documentation:** The best place to start is the official LangChain documentation.  It\\'s well-structured and provides comprehensive tutorials and examples.  Look for their \"Getting Started\" guides and work your way through the examples.\\n\\n**2. Tutorials and Blog Posts:** Many tutorials and blog posts are available online that cover various aspects of LangChain. Search for \"LangChain tutorial\" or \"LangChain example\" on Google, YouTube, or Medium.  Look for tutorials that focus on specific use cases that interest you, such as building a chatbot or a question-answering system.\\n\\n**3. GitHub Repository:** Explore the LangChain GitHub repository.  You can find the source code, contribute to the project, and see how different components are implemented.  Reading the code can be a great way to deepen your understanding.\\n\\n**4. Example Projects:**  The LangChain documentation and GitHub repository contain many example projects.  Start by running and modifying these examples to understand how different parts of the framework work together.  Try to break them and see what happens – this is a great way to learn.\\n\\n**5. Community and Forums:** Engage with the LangChain community.  Ask questions on forums like Stack Overflow or join the LangChain Discord server (if one exists).  This is a great way to get help and learn from others\\' experiences.\\n\\n**6. Courses (Future Possibility):** While there aren\\'t many dedicated LangChain courses yet, as the framework is relatively new, you might find relevant courses on broader topics like large language models (LLMs) or building AI applications.  These courses might include sections on LangChain or provide a foundation that makes learning LangChain easier.\\n\\n\\n**To get started quickly, I recommend:**\\n\\n* **Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts:** Understand what LLMs are and how they work.  Having a basic understanding of Python programming is also essential.\\n* **Follow the official \"Getting Started\" guide:** This will walk you through setting up LangChain and running a simple example.\\n* **Choose a specific project:**  Instead of trying to learn everything at once, focus on a specific application you want to build (e.g., a chatbot, a summarizer, a question-answering system).  This will give you a clear goal and help you focus your learning.\\n\\n\\nRemember to be patient and persistent.  Learning a new framework takes time and effort.
